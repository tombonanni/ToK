# ToK
Text based RPG(WIP)
X Steps to having a great time while playing ToK:


1. [RUNNING THE GAME]

This game is played in the command line so the first step is to open
the command line. Start -> Type "cmd" into the search field -> press Enter or click on the cmd option that comes up.

Great! Now that your command line is up, make sure that your directory is pointing to the correct location -- the location where you saved these files to! The command to change where the directory is pointing is:

	cd "Directory Adress"

	Example (the file is saved in C:\Users\Bob\Games):

	C:\Users\Bob>cd C:\Users\Bob\Games    (This is what you type in)

	C:\Users\Bob\Games>          (This is what should appear on the next line)

If your directory has changed you are now ready to run the game. Simply type:

	java -jar Tok.jar     (Case sensitive!)

Press Enter and the game should start running!



2. [KNOW YOUR COMMANDS]
